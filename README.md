Population genetics of cichlid fish in lakes Victoria, Kivu and Mweru

This is the code repository for our paper, *Evaluating genomic divergence and 
parallelism in replicate ecomorphs from young and old cichlid adaptive radiations*
by [Matt McGee](https://github.com/sticklematt), 
[Russell Neches](https://github.com/ryneches/) and
[Ole Seehausen](http://www.eawag.ch/en/aboutus/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/ole-seehausen/),
manuscript ID MEC-15-0615.R2. 

In addition to many of the key intermediate data files, we have
included the following pieces of code and data required to reproduce
our results.
